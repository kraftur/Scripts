# Scripts
Pentesting scripts

Net_Ninja: 
    This a work in progress. I am creating this script to make my life a little easier for the upcomming OSPC exam. Feel free to use this script and or change it to your own liking.

    The user has options inside the script for which scans to run. I will be adding secondary scans that will further enumerate the open ports found in the first set of scans.
